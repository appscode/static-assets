            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

            entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed
            and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces
            significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any
            actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed
            in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible
            for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value,
            external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer
            later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering
            finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable
            to ordering changes in the list.

        ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.

        ObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template` and `MachineSet.Template`, which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies the API and some issues that can impact user experience.

        During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054) for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs, specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`. The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.

        In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta` had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time). The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null` which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.

        In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.

    This document defines the Open API specification of the services that Cluster API runtime is going to call while managing the Cluster's lifecycle.

    Services described in this specification are also referred to as Runtime Hooks, given that they allow external components to hook-in the cluster's lifecycle. The corresponding components implementing handlers for Runtime Hooks calls are referred to as Runtime Extensions.

    More information is available in the [Cluster API book](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

        Cluster API Runtime will call this hook when an ExtensionConfig is reconciled. Runtime Extension implementers must use this hook to inform the Cluster API runtime about all the handlers that are defined in an external component implementing Runtime Extensions.

        Cluster API Runtime will call this hook when a Cluster's topology is being computed during each topology controller reconcile loop. More specifically, this hook will be called while computing patches to be applied on top of templates derived from the Cluster's ClusterClass.
