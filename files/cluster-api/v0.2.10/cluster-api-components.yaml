                        Example use case is cluster autoscaler with cluster-api as

                        to nodes to find out machines at provider which could not
                        get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

                        required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view
                        of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                        from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find

                        field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher
                        level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with
