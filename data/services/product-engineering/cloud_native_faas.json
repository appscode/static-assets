      {
    "question": "What do your Cloud Native FaaS Services include?",
    "answer": "Our Cloud Native FaaS Services cover the complete lifecycle of building serverless, event-driven applications — from discovery and MVP design to engineering, DevOps automation, deployment, and scaling. We combine disciplined processes and cloud-native best practices to deliver secure, high-performing, and scalable solutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which technologies and practices do you use for cloud-native and FaaS development?",
    "answer": "We use Kubernetes, Knative, and other serverless frameworks to enable scalable Function-as-a-Service workloads. Our practices include CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automated testing, observability, and multi-cloud or hybrid deployments — ensuring flexibility and operational consistency."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you integrate with our existing roadmap or tech stack for FaaS development?",
    "answer": "Yes. Our engineers can extend your existing roadmap or modernize your architecture with serverless and cloud-native patterns. Whether you already have microservices or are starting from scratch, we help design, containerize, and deploy functions efficiently on your chosen cloud environment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical timeline and engagement model for Cloud Native FaaS projects?",
    "answer": "Most Cloud Native FaaS engagements start with a short discovery phase (1–2 weeks) to align goals and architecture, followed by agile sprints of 4–8 weeks for development. We offer flexible models such as fixed-scope builds, time-and-materials, or dedicated engineering support for continuous innovation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you support multi-cloud or hybrid environments for FaaS solutions?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Our Cloud Native FaaS architecture supports public clouds like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, as well as on-premises Kubernetes clusters. We ensure portability and scalability across environments using open standards and cloud-agnostic tooling."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure quality, security, and reliability in your Cloud Native FaaS Services?",
    "answer": "Quality and reliability are built in through automated testing, peer code reviews, continuous integration, and real-time monitoring. Security is enforced with role-based access, secrets management, and vulnerability scanning. Our cloud-native frameworks deliver resilient, production-grade performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after deployment of our FaaS product?",
    "answer": "After deployment, we help monitor performance, optimize execution time, and scale functions based on workload demand. Our team continues to enhance observability, automation, and cost optimization to keep your Cloud Native FaaS Services efficient and future-ready."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much do Cloud Native FaaS Services cost?",
    "answer": "Pricing depends on project scope, function complexity, cloud platform, and ongoing support. We offer flexible options — from fixed-price MVP builds to time-based or retainer models for continuous serverless development. A detailed estimate follows our discovery phase."
