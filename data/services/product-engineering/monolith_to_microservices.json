  "faq": [
    {
    "question": "What does your Monolith to Microservices service include?",
    "answer": "Our Monolith to Microservices service covers the complete transformation journey — from assessing your existing monolithic application, defining migration strategy, refactoring architecture, and implementing CI/CD pipelines, to deploying containerized microservices on Kubernetes. We focus on building scalable, resilient, and maintainable systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which technologies and practices do you use for Monolith to Microservices migration?",
    "answer": "We leverage Kubernetes, Docker, API gateways, service meshes, and microservices frameworks to break down monolithic systems. Our practices include continuous delivery (CI/CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), observability, and DevOps automation to ensure smooth, low-risk migration."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you modernize our existing monolithic application without a full rebuild?",
    "answer": "Yes. We can progressively decompose your existing monolithic system into microservices without requiring a complete rewrite. Our engineers identify independent modules, containerize them, and migrate gradually while maintaining system stability and minimizing downtime."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical timeline and engagement model for Monolith to Microservices migration?",
    "answer": "Every migration is unique, but we usually start with a 1–2 week discovery phase to evaluate your architecture and define a migration roadmap. Then we execute in agile sprints of 4–8 weeks. Engagement options include fixed-scope projects, time-and-materials, or dedicated engineering partnerships."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you support hybrid or multi-cloud environments during microservices migration?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. We design microservices architectures that run seamlessly on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or on-premises Kubernetes clusters. Our Monolith to Microservices approach ensures portability, scalability, and operational consistency across different environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure quality, security, and reliability during the migration process?",
    "answer": "We apply automated testing, code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, and continuous observability to maintain quality throughout the migration. Security is enforced through container isolation, secrets management, and RBAC. Reliability is achieved via gradual rollouts, monitoring, and automated recovery patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after migrating from Monolith to Microservices?",
    "answer": "Post-migration, we help you optimize performance, improve DevOps automation, and monitor service health. We also assist with scaling, cost optimization, and training your team to manage and evolve the new microservices architecture effectively."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much does Monolith to Microservices migration cost?",
    "answer": "The cost depends on factors such as the size and complexity of your monolithic system, the number of services to extract, cloud platform preferences, and ongoing support needs. We provide flexible pricing models — from fixed-scope projects to long-term retainers — after the discovery phase."
