    "question": "What do your Progressive Delivery Consulting Services include?",
    "answer": "Our Progressive Delivery Consulting Services cover the full lifecycle of cloud-native product delivery — from opportunity discovery and MVP development to engineering, DevOps, deployment, and scaling. We focus on enabling safe, controlled releases and building resilient, high-performing systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which technologies and practices are used in progressive delivery consulting?",
    "answer": "We leverage Kubernetes orchestration, microservices architecture, continuous delivery pipelines (CI/CD), automated testing, infrastructure as code, observability, and hybrid/multi-cloud deployment patterns. These practices help teams implement feature rollouts safely and maintain operational confidence."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you work with our existing product roadmap and stack?",
    "answer": "Yes — we can integrate with your current roadmap and architecture. Our engineers refine existing systems, enable progressive delivery workflows, and lift your platform into a containerized, cloud-native, and production-ready state."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical timeline and engagement model for Progressive Delivery Consulting Services?",
    "answer": "Most engagements start with a 1–2 week discovery phase to align on goals, architecture, and MVP scope. Development continues in 4–8 week agile sprints. Engagement models include fixed-scope projects, time-and-materials with embedded engineers, or longer-term consulting partnerships."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you support multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Our Progressive Delivery Consulting Services are designed to be cloud-agnostic, supporting AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises Kubernetes clusters. This ensures consistent, safe deployments across different environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure quality, security, and reliability during progressive delivery?",
    "answer": "Quality is ensured through automated testing, code reviews, and continuous integration. Security is baked in with container isolation, role-based access control, secrets management, and vulnerability scanning. Reliability is maintained with monitoring, backup/recovery, and disaster resilience patterns."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after the product is launched?",
    "answer": "After launch, we help monitor performance, optimize infrastructure, and scale the system. Progressive Delivery Consulting Services also include implementing feature rollouts, canary releases, and automated rollback strategies to maintain operational confidence."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much do Progressive Delivery Consulting Services cost, and what are the pricing models?",
    "answer": "Pricing depends on project scope, complexity, number of teams, and ongoing support requirements. We offer flexible models such as fixed-price MVP builds, hourly or engagement-based workflows, and retainers for continuous consulting and progressive delivery support. A detailed proposal is provided after the discovery phase."
