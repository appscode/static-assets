    {
    "question": "What do your Platform Engineering Services include?",
    "answer": "Our Platform Engineering Services cover the full lifecycle of building and maintaining cloud-native platforms: from opportunity discovery, MVP development, engineering and DevOps practices, to deployment, monitoring, and scaling. We focus on creating reliable, secure, and high-performing platforms for your organization."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which technologies and practices are used in your platform engineering?",
    "answer": "We leverage Kubernetes orchestration, microservices architecture, continuous delivery pipelines (CI/CD), automated testing, infrastructure as code, observability (monitoring/logging), and hybrid/multi-cloud deployment patterns to ensure platform stability and scalability."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you work with our existing product roadmap and tech stack?",
    "answer": "Yes — we can integrate with your current roadmap and architecture. Our engineers refine your existing platform, lift it into a containerized, cloud-native, and production-ready form, or build new components from scratch as needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical timeline and engagement model for Platform Engineering Services?",
    "answer": "We usually start with a short discovery phase (1–2 weeks) to align on goals, architecture, and MVP scope. Development continues in 4–8 week agile sprints. Engagement models include fixed-scope projects, time-and-materials with embedded engineers, or longer-term dedicated platform engineering support."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you support multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Our Platform Engineering Services are designed to be cloud-agnostic, ready to deploy on public clouds such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises Kubernetes clusters. This ensures portability, scalability, and operational consistency across environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure quality, security, and reliability in the platforms you build?",
    "answer": "We ensure quality through automated testing, code reviews, and continuous integration. Security is baked in via container isolation, role-based access, secrets management, and vulnerability scanning. Reliability is maintained with production-grade patterns, monitoring, backup/recovery, and disaster resilience."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after the platform is launched?",
    "answer": "After launch, we help monitor performance, optimize infrastructure, and scale the system. Our Platform Engineering Services also include continuous improvements, automation, and tuning to ensure long-term reliability and cost efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much do Platform Engineering Services cost and what are the pricing models?",
    "answer": "Pricing depends on project scope, complexity, number of teams, and ongoing support requirements. We offer flexible models such as fixed-price MVP builds, hourly or engagement-based workflows, and retainers for continuous platform engineering and scaling. A detailed proposal is provided after the discovery phase."
