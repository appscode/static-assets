  "faq": [
     {
    "question": "What do your Backstage Consulting & Support Services include?",
    "answer": "Our Backstage Consulting & Support Services cover the full lifecycle of building and maintaining cloud-native platforms: from opportunity discovery, MVP development, engineering, and DevOps practices to deployment, monitoring, and scaling. We focus on delivering reliable, secure, and high-performing systems that support your business goals."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which technologies and practices are used in your consulting and support services?",
    "answer": "We leverage Kubernetes orchestration, microservices architecture, continuous delivery pipelines (CI/CD), automated testing, infrastructure as code, observability (monitoring/logging), and hybrid/multi-cloud deployment patterns. These practices ensure platform stability, scalability, and operational efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you work with our existing product roadmap and technology stack?",
    "answer": "Yes — we can integrate with your current roadmap and architecture. Our engineers refine your existing platform, lift it into a containerized, cloud-native, and production-ready form, or build new components from scratch as required."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the typical timeline and engagement model for Backstage Consulting & Support Services?",
    "answer": "We typically start with a 1–2 week discovery phase to align on goals, architecture, and MVP scope. Development continues in 4–8 week agile sprints. Engagement models include fixed-scope projects, time-and-materials with embedded engineers, or longer-term dedicated support partnerships."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you support multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Our Backstage Consulting & Support Services are designed to be cloud-agnostic, ready to deploy on public clouds such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises Kubernetes clusters. This ensures portability, scalability, and operational consistency across environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure quality, security, and reliability in your services?",
    "answer": "We ensure quality through automated testing, code reviews, and continuous integration. Security is baked in via container isolation, role-based access control (RBAC), secrets management, and vulnerability scanning. Reliability is maintained with production-grade patterns, monitoring, backup/recovery, and disaster resilience."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after deployment?",
    "answer": "After launch, we help monitor performance, optimize infrastructure, and scale the system. Our Backstage Consulting & Support Services also include continuous improvements, automation, and tuning to ensure long-term reliability and operational efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much do Backstage Consulting & Support Services cost and what are the pricing models?",
    "answer": "Pricing depends on project scope, complexity, number of teams, and ongoing support requirements. We offer flexible models such as fixed-price MVP builds, hourly or engagement-based workflows, and retainers for continuous consulting and platform support. A detailed proposal is provided after the discovery phase."
