      "description": "Secrets Store CSI Driver for Kubernetes secrets - Integrates secrets stores with Kubernetes via a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume. It allows Kubernetes to mount multiple secrets, keys, and certs stored in enterprise-grade external secrets stores into their pods as a volume. Once the Volume is attached, the data in it is mounted into the containerâ€™s file system. KubeVault operator works seamlessly with Secrets Store CSI Driver. This is one of the recommended ways to mount Vault Secrets into Kubernetes resources along with Vault Agent Sidecar Injector. Secrets Store CSI Driver requires a SecretProviderClass which is a namespaced resource that is used to provide driver configurations and provider-specific parameters to the CSI driver. Writing these SecretProviderClass can be a tedious job, but KubeVault CLI lets you generate SecretProviderClass using simple CLI commands.",
