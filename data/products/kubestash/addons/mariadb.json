  "description": "Kubernetes is becoming a vital aspect of enterprise IT environments as businesses increasingly rely on containerized applications. And a large amount of data is generated by business applications and microservices everyday, which must be protected with a reliable backup and recovery solution. <br /> <br /> But the problem is traditional backup and restore solutions were not designed for Kubernetes. If you want to copy a Kubernetes cluster over platforms, you have to face so many difficulties during the process. And when the application grows in size, you need to create a lot of new custom scripts to take snapshots of your pods, services, volumes, configmaps, secrets, and have to continuously maintain those scripts. Stash is a complete Kubernetes native disaster recovery solution for backup and restore Kubernetes workloads, volumes and databases on various public and private clouds. <br /> <br /> As we already know, traditional tools are too complex to setup and maintain in a dynamic compute environment like Kubernetes. Stash is a Kubernetes operator that uses restic or Kubernetes CSI Driver VolumeSnapshotter functionality to address these issues. Using Stash, you can backup Kubernetes volumes mounted in workloads, stand-alone volumes and databases. Users may even extend Stash via addons for any custom workload.",
